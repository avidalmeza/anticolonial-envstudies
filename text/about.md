**About this Repository**
<br>
Anticolonial voices in environmental studies coursework are frequently homogenized, unaccredited, and romanticized for a skewed Eurocentric viewpoint. This nonexhaustive repository includes several learning materials, like peer-reviewed papers, podcasts, talks, and articles. It was initially compiled for the University of Puget Sound by Alessandra Vidal Meza and Danny Kedansky in May 2022.
