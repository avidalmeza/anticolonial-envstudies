# Tools and topics for anticolonial environmental studies

Anticolonial voices in environmental studies coursework are often homogenized, unaccredited, and romanticized for a skewed Eurocentric viewpoint. This non-exhaustive repository includes several learning materials, such as peer-reviewed papers, podcasts, talks, and articles, with the aim of informing and diversifying the curriculum.
